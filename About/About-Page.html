        <h3>My background</h3>
        <p>Once upon a time, there was a white doodle man named Bob. Bob was born with a rare condition that caused him to constantly shrug his shoulders. Despite his condition, Bob was a happy-go-lucky guy who loved to make people laugh.
            <br>
         Bob grew up in a small town where he was always the center of attention. His friends and family found his constant shrugging to be hilarious and would often ask him to perform for their amusement. Bob never minded though; he loved making people happy.</p>
            <br>
        As Bob got older, he decided to take his talent on the road and become a professional comedian. He created a whole act around his shrugging, using it to punctuate his jokes and add an extra layer of humor. His act became a hit, and he traveled the world performing in front of sold-out crowds.</p>
            <br>
        One day, while performing in Las Vegas, Bob met a beautiful woman named Sally. Sally was a fellow comedian who also had a quirky sense of humor. They hit it off immediately and fell in love.</p>
            <br>
        Bob and Sally got married and continued to perform together, each using their unique talents to make people laugh. They became known as the "Dynamic Duo of Comedy" and were beloved by fans around the world.</p>
            <br>
        And so, Bob continued to shrug his way through life, always finding the humor in every situation. He never let his condition hold him back and inspired others to embrace their quirks and be true to themselves.</p>
